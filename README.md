Task 1: Creating a simple mathematical calculator (10 Marks)
In this task, you are required to write a program that can perform the four basic mathematical operations i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The program should start with a suitable welcome message and then ask the user about the mathematical operation they want to perform. Once an operation is selected, the program should ask the user to supply the two operands for the selected operation. The program
should then display the result of the operation in a suitable manner. Verify that your program works correctly by testing it with suitable test inputs. Save your code in a file named task1.c. Moreover, copy your code to a word file named Yourlastname_Assignment2.
